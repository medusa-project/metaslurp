##
# Singleton interface to the application configuration.
#
# # Usage
#
# `Configuration.instance.key_name` (shorthand for
# `Configuration.instance.get(:key_name)`)
#
# # How the configuration system works
#
# The configuration system works in two different ways depending on the Rails
# environment:
#
# 1. In the development and test environments, there are unencrypted
#    YAML configuration files in the `config/credentials` directory. These can
#    be edited normally and are **not** committed to version control.
# 2. The demo and production environments utilize the "multi-environment
#    credentials" system introduced in Rails 6. There are separate encrypted
#    demo and production files and accompanying master keys. (The `.enc` files
#    are committed to version control but the `.key` files are not.) To edit,
#    use `rails credentials:edit -e <demo or production>`.
#
# This class abstracts all of the above so that a call to
# `Configuration.instance.key_name` is all you need.
#
